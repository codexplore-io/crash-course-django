== Django Framework Part Three
We have covered how you can use Django to interact with the front end of your website.
You can use views to pass information between .html files and your Django back end and other scripts.

However, how do we style our templates?
We have many different .html files, so how can we use the same CSS classes across all of them?
What if we want to link to let's say, Bootstrap.
Do we need to include the `<link>` in every .html file?
That seems excessive.
Luckily, Django makes it easy to organize your templates without having to repeat yourself.

=== Template Inheritance
Django has a very handy syntax and method to efficiently create dynamic templates.
You will generally want one template to keep all of your project level stylesheets and scripts.
Things like Bootstrap and JQuery would likely be included in this.
We will create a project level .html file that will be inherited from in other templates.

So, let's create that file, called "base.html" in your templates folder.
It will be in the root directory of the templates folder.
Just set up the .html file as if it was a normal .html file.
Now, we will create the method of being able to inherit this template.
Within the `<body>` tag, we will need to use Django template language.
First, you will use the keyword `block` within the Django template tags.
This is where your children templates will be located.
Then, you use the keyword `endblock` to end the block.

It should look like this:

[#img-141]
[.text-center]
.Template Extending
image::14_1.png[Template Extending]

This is all we need to be able to extend this template so that we can inherit all of the scripts and styles from this template.
The phrase `base_content` can be changed to whatever you want, as long as it is consistent with the name in `endblock`.
In fact, you don't need to even put a name in `endblock`.
If you don't, it will just end the block corresponding to the closest `block` tag.
I find it helpful to repeat the name in each `endblock`, as it makes it easier to keep track of the content when you are nesting different templates.

This can all be very confusing, so let's start looking at how to inherit the "base.html" content in our other templates.
Let's change our other templates so that it inherits from "base.html".
First, we will need to "extend" our "base.html" template.
Then, we will need to specify in the new file where the `base_content` begins and ends.
Let's start with our "posts/list.html".

We can change our current html to the following:

[#img-142]
[.text-center]
.Template Inheritance
image::14_2.png[Template Inheritance]

The first line `{% extends 'posts/base.html' %}` tells the template where we will be inheriting from.
Then, we type the lines `{% content base_content %}` and `{% endblock base_content %}`.
The way Django works is by "injecting" the content within the content tags in the child page into the `base.html` page.

[#img-143]
[.text-center]
.Post List View
image::14_3.png[Post List View]

We can tell that this works by looking at the tab.
It says "Blog Project", which means the `<title>` tag from the 'base.html' is included with the `post_list_view` template.
So, now that we have this, we can do the same thing with our other templates, that is 'posts/create.html', 'posts/detail.html', 'posts/delete.html' and 'posts/update.html'.

Next, we can add some style sheets and Javascript scripts.
Let's add Bootstrap to the 'base.html' file.

[#img-144]
[.text-center]
.Adding Bootstrap
image::14_4.png[Adding Bootstrap]

We add the stylesheet in the `<head>` and we will put the scripts after the content.
If we refresh our `post_list_view`, it will look like this:

[#img-145]
[.text-center]
.Adding Bootstrap
image::14_5.png[Adding Bootstrap]

Now, it is updated with Bootstrap's styles and font family.
If it does not have a different style, then something has gone wrong.

=== Restyling the Project using Bootstrap
Now that we have Bootstrap integrated, let's go into our templates and make them look better, starting with the 'posts/list.html'.
I will be briefly explaining how to style the page, but most of the items are built on what we learned from the Bootstrap chapter.
First, let's wrap our entire `base_content` within a Bootstrap container.
In your 'base.html', it will look like this:

----
<div class = "container">
    {% block base_content %}
    {% endblock base_content %}
</div>
----

This will give us some room on each side so the content is not hugging the sides of the viewport.
Now, go to 'localhost:8000/posts/list'.
It does not look good.
Ideally, we would like to have a header on the page that says "All Posts", with a button to create a post.
Then, we will have a list of all of the posts in the program.
We can wrap the "All Posts" within an `<h1>` tag and use Bootstrap's `btn` class for the create a post button.
Then, we will add some margin to the top of the page so it does not hug against the top of the browser.
Using Bootstrap, our 'posts/list.html' file will look like the following:

[#img-146]
[.text-center]
.Post List HTML
image::14_6.png[Post List HTML]

When we go the actual URL for the 'post_list_view', we see the following (I created more posts for filler):

[#img-147]
[.text-center]
.Post List in Browser
image::14_7.png[Post List in Browser]

It looks better already.
Now let's go to the create view.
We will style the title of "Create New Post" in the same way we did for the "All Posts".
Then, we will add the Bootstrap formatting for the forms.
A form is created as usual.
In Bootstrap, each pairing of the labels and form inputs will be wrapped by a `<div>` with a class of `form-group`.
Then, the input has a class of `form-control`.
I also added a "Cancel" button that will go back to the `post_list_view`.

Your HTML should look like the following:

[#img-148]
[.text-center]
.Post Create HTML
image::14_8.png[Post Create HTML]

When we go to 'localhost:8000/posts/create', we should see the following in the browser:

[#img-149]
[.text-center]
.Post Create in Browser
image::14_9.png[Post Create in Browser]

We will do something similar with 'posts/update.html'.
We will change our .html file to look like the following:

[#img-1410]
[.text-center]
.Post Update in HTML
image::14_10.png[Post Update in HTML]

We also changed the link for our cancel to go back to the specific `post_detail_view` corresponding to the post that we are working on.
This will look like the following:

[#img-1411]
[.text-center]
.Post Update in Browser
image::14_11.png[Post Update in Browser]

Lastly, let's change the 'posts/detail.html'.
We should probably center name of the article, and make sure it has a top margin.
Then, we should make sure to change the buttons to look nice.
I changed the html to have Bootstrap classes and used the `display-4` class to make the title look a little nicer.

The HTML will look like this now:

[#img-1412]
[.text-center]
.Post Detail in HTML
image::14_12.png[Post Detail in HTML]

And then in the browser:

[#img-1413]
[.text-center]
.Post Detail in Browser
image::14_13.png[Post Detail in Browser]

Lastly, let's change our 'posts/delete.html' file.
We will need to style our buttons, and make sure that the "Yes" button to confirm the deletion is red, so the user knows that it will delete the current post.
Our HTML will now look like this:

[#img-1414]
[.text-center]
.Post Delete in HTML
image::14_14.png[Post Delete in HTML]

And it looks like this in our browser:

[#img-1415]
[.text-center]
.Post Delete in Browser
image::14_15.png[Post Delete in Browser]

Now, our project looks a lot better for the users of it.
What if we have parts of our code that are repetitive?
Well, we don't want to repeat our self, so we will use Django's `include` tool.

=== Including Other Files
Extending templates works great when you need to use certain elements on every page, and it is static across each file.
However, what if you want to pick and choose when you use a certain snippet of code?
Well, Django has a handy tool in its template language to do that.

----
{% include 'file_name.html' %}
----

If you write the preceding code in a Django template, it will "inject" the html from the file that you include.
If we were to look at our code, a very large chunk of code is repeated - the form for creating and updating posts.
So, let's create a code snippet that we can inject into our other templates.
Let's put it in 'posts/snippets/form.html'.
Then, copy the form from the 'posts/update.html' into the 'posts/snippets/form.html'.

It should look like this:

[#img-1416]
[.text-center]
.Form
image::14_16.png[Form]

We want to be able to reuse this form on both the create and update pages, so we will need to move the `{% 'posts:detail' id=post.id %}`.
This is because it is relying on the context which has 'post.id' in it.
The `post_create_view` does not have any context, so we would get an error on the redirect.
There are a couple ways we can do this.
Let's just remove the "Cancel" button to the outside of the 'form.html'.
So, it will now look like this:

[#img-1417]
[.text-center]
.Form without cancel
image::14_17.png[Form]

Then, we will move the `<a>` tag outside of the form and put them within the 'create.html' and 'update.html'.
The "Cancel" button within the 'create.html' will redirect to the `post_list_view` and the "Cancel" button within the 'update.html' will redirect to the `post_detail_view`.
So, we will include the file via {% include 'posts/snippets/form.html' %}.
The 'posts/create.html' should look like this.

[#img-1418]
[.text-center]
.posts/create.html
image::14_18.png[posts/create.html]

This is how we can reuse the form content.
What about 'posts/update.html'?
We will need to send a post to it.
We do that using `with` in the `{% include %}` tag.
It will look like this:

[#img-1419]
[.text-center]
.posts/update.html
image::14_19.png[posts/update.html]

This is how we send variables to a form via the `{% include %}` tag.
This feature is very picky when it comes to syntax, so you may have problems purely because of the syntax.
You will now realize that the "Cancel" button is below the form.
This is a quick fix by adding `class="d-inline"` to the `<form>` tag in 'posts/snippets/form.html'.

Now that we have the basic views set up, and we aren't rewriting ode, we are able to add more styling to our app.
