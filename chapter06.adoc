== Introduction to Django and Back End Development
We have finally reached Django!
I hope you are excited.
We will finally be putting together all of your knowledge and learn how to create full stack web apps.
This chapter will first focus on high level definitions and concepts, and then we will jump right into Django.
Try not to stress out too much when we make our "Hello World" program.
I will be flying through many different concepts - I just want to get you familiar with the overall picture.
The following chapters will go more in depth about the different parts of the Django environment.

=== Understanding the Back End
The back end of a website, in simplest terms, is the part of the website that deals with the data of the website.
You can think of most websites and web apps as a database with a mask on it.
Let's consider at a simple example - what if you wanted to make a version of YouTube from scratch.
Well, there are a few things to consider.

First, you want to look at the user's point of view.
What is the easiest way for them to post videos, search videos and interact with other users?
Next, you want to look at the back end - what is the best way to store all of the videos and information, such as users, video descriptions, video names, etc.?
You will make a database that holds all of this information.
If you really wanted to, you can just make a database, then make everyone learn SQL so that they can query different videos and users.
Or, you can put a mask on the database - and create buttons to perform different queries.

Let's say you wanted to search for a video.
A search bar and a search button are all you need to create a simple query in the database.
This is the "mask" that makes it easier.
But the main functionality of dynamic websites comes from the back end.

NOTE: I am not sure if I had heard of this "mask" metaphor from someone else
If I am suing someone else's metaphor, let me know and I will give proper attribute.

Django is a back end framework that uses Python.
Flask is another framework that uses Python.
Node.js is an extremely popular one that uses Javascript.
Ruby on Rails is one that uses Ruby.
There are many different frameworks, and Django is just one of them.
When you hear these terms being thrown around, they are simply ways to help build out dynamic websites using different languages.

==== Servers and Databases
Before we start going into Django, we should talk about servers and databases on a higher level.

A *server* can be thought of as a computer that performs tasks.
I purposely left this as a vague, general statement because it will help you actually understand what it is.
When you are accessing a website, you are asking for something from a server.
The server is what stores all of the information and gives you the data and/or files back.

So, when you go to www.google.com, you are asking Google's server to display the .html file that will help you search for whatever it is you are looking for.
Your computer can act as a server.
In fact, when you are developing an application locally, you will use your computer as the server.
Django has a very easy way to do this, and you will be able to get up and running quickly.

When you deploy your app, you will essentially be copying all of your project files to another location instead of your own computer.
We call your local environment your development server and the server you will be using for deployment your production server.

A *database* is a collection of data.
Databases can be in various different formats.
An easy example is in Excel.
If you want to create a database, you can create a new workbook.
Each sheet will be a table.
You can save this workbook with all of the information, and it will be, in effect, a database.

However, when we are talking about back end development, we are not referring to an Excel spreadsheet as a database.
Databases will typically rely on a language called Structured Query Language (SQL).
SQL is a widely used language that helps manage the data in your databases through queries.
A *query* is a command that will create, update, retrieve or delete data in your database.

When you are making a Django project, your data will likely be held in a database that uses SQL.
Django makes it easy to communicate with SQL databases, as we will learn.

=== What is Django
Django is a web development framework that is written in Python.
It creates an easy way to create large, scalable web apps that can easily link up the front and back end.
Django is a combination of many different modules that allows for things such as serving static files on the front end, managing your database schema, and organizing your routing.

Django's official website brands Django as "The Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines."
You can get it up and running extremely quickly, and it is very programmer friendly.
Let's see how it works from a high level point of view.

=== Model View Template (MVT)
Django is built on the Model-View-Template (MVT) framework.
The MVT framework is how a web app is organized when going between the front end (client side) and back end (server side).

[#img-121]
[.text-center]
.Model View Template
image::12_1.png[Model View Template]

As you can tell in the figure above, there are a few steps to see how Django works under the scenes.
First, you start off at your computer.
Let's say you go to a website that is built with Django.
It goes to the website address, let's say http://www.codexplore.io[www.codexplore.io].
When it visits this website, it looks through all of the possible URL routes to look for the route that you submitted.
Once it finds the URL route, it will call for a View to be shown to the user.

The View can show static data or can access the database.
If it is static, the view just returns a Template (html) file to the url router and displays it on the screen for the user.
If the View needs to access the database, it will do so by looking through the Models and returning a query to the View.
Once the View has the data, it will send the data to a Template to display the data on the .html file, and then send that template back to the url router which will send it to the user.

It can be easy to think about it as an assembly line.
Every stop is going to be a function that is called, and will likely return another function or some other information.
It will go down the assembly line by calling all of the functions.
Then, when it reaches the final function call, it starts returning all of the information back to the functions and will eventually return the .html file to the client.
Let's start using Django to see how Django projects are organized within the actual code.

=== Installing Django
Since you have Python already installed on your computer, you can easily install Django using the following command

[literal]
pip install django

This command will install the most up to date version of Django.
The most current long term support (LTS) version of Django is 1.11, but it is not the most current version.
This book uses any version of Django 1.11 and later, so you can use whichever version you would like.
I will make sure to explain any major differences in implementation between different versions as we go along.

=== First Django Project
Now that we have Django installed, open up a command prompt.
Once the prompt is open, navigate to a folder, or create one in the prompt.
It can be saved in any part of your computer that you want.
A Django project is just a collection of python files, so you can save those files in a place that is most organized for you.

Once you are in the directory that you want to create your Django project, type the following command:

[literal]
django-admin startproject myproject

There are three parts to this command.
First, we type in `django-admin`.
This let's our computer know that we want to create a Django app, and that the following code will correspond with Django's commands.
The next part is `startproject`.
This tells Django that we want to create a new Django project, and it will create all the files and folders that we need to do so.
Lastly, we typed in `myproject`.
Django will name the project "myproject".
We could make this last argument anything we want, as long as it follows Django's naming guidelines.
It will reject any names that are incompatible with Django.

Let it take some time to create the project if it does take time.
Once you do, open the project in your favorite text editor.
I use Atom, so a blank project will look like the following:

[#img-122]
[.text-center]
.First Django Project
image::12_2.png[First Django Project]

In Atom and most text editors, the folder you are in will show up on the left side and you can expand or shrink what you see.

Django projects have a subfolder that is the same name as the project.
This subfolder has the default project level folders.

=== Django environment walkthrough

First, the `__init__.py` file is simply a Python convention for things like importing.
Next, there is the `settings.py` file.
This is an extremely important file that we will be using quite often.
When you open it, you will see many different variables.
These are all variables that your project will be using when calling different functions and performing different tasks.
You will notice as you scroll through this file, that it is simply a collection of strings, lists, dictionaries and other variables.
We will not go into specifics of each variable now, as it will only make sense while we progress through Django.

After our `settings.py`, we see our `urls.py`.
This file is where all of our urls will be saved.
We will have different patterns that the user can browse.
Django will look for the url pattern that is in the address bar.
We will go into this later.

The last file is not a large concern for a while.
`wsgi.py` is a configuration file when your project is deployed.
We will get into this later, but it is good to know that it is there and what it generally does.

A Django project is built with many different apps.
This seems a little confusing, because we have been talking about building a web app.
Within the Django framework, the Django project will be your web app.
The Django project is then broken up into different apps that do different specific functions for your project.

In the command prompt, make sure that you are in the Django project folder.
If you list the files in the directory, you will see the `myproject` folder and a `manage.py` file.

Let's say we are making a blog project.
We will make an app that specifically deals with blog posts.
In terms of architecture, each app will be named after the main data table (or Model) that your app focuses on.
So, we will create a data table to hold all of the posts.
We will go more into specifics when we learn about Models.

In order to create an app, we type in the following line of code

[literal]
python manage.py startapp posts

There are four parts to this command, so let's walk through them.
First, `python` tells the command prompt that the following code will be a Python command.
`manage.py` runs the python script `manage.py` that is located in your project directory.
Then, `startapp` will tell the `manage.py` script which command it will run.
If you are bored, you can look into `the manage.py` file and then look at the Django docs to understand those two steps more.
The last portion defines the name of the app, `posts`.
This can be named anything you want within the guidelines of the Django naming conventions.

When you run this command, wait for it to complete.
Your Django project will now look like this in your text editor.

[#img-123]
[.text-center]
.Django Project with Posts App
image::12_3.png[Django Project with Posts App]

A new folder has appeared!
Congratulations on making your first app.
We have also been introduced to a few new Python files.

First, we have `admin.py`.
This file will deal with features on the admin section of your website relative to this app.
Each Django project has an already built out Admin interface that allows you to work with your project easily.

Next, we have `apps.py`.
This is really outside the scope of this book.

Then, there is `models.py`.
This will be where you will put your Model - the "M" in MVT - for your app.
We will eventually create an object in here called `Post`, which inherits from `models.Model`, but we will get there.

`tests.py` is where you will put code for testing your other code.
We will not be using this much in the context of this book, but writing tests for your code can save you a lot of time.

Lastly, but certainly not least, we have `views.py`.
This is where we put all of our views for our app, the "V" in MVT.

Whenever you create a new app, you need to go into your `settings.py` for your project, and scroll down to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list.
Then, you write the name of your new app in the list.
It should look like the following:

[#img-124]
[.text-center]
.Adding new app to `settings.py`
image::12_4.png[Adding new app to `settings.py`]

We will learn why this is important in more detail, but make this a habit whenever you create a new app.

=== Hello World program
Let's start with our first app.
Go back to the command prompt and type the following command in:

[literal]
python manage.py runserver

This is a very powerful command that is worth looking at.
Django works by using Python.
Python is a language that requires some sort of execution, so Django will need to run on a server.
What this command does is create a local server that will serve as your development environment.
Once you run this command, you will see the following in your command prompt:

[#img-125]
[.text-center]
.Starting up Django server
image::12_5.png[Starting up Django server]

There is a line that starts with "Starting development server at..." after running the `runserver` command.
If you copy the url in that line into your address bar, you will see something like this:

[#img-126]
[.text-center]
.localhost:8000
image::12_6.png[localhost:8000]

This is your main page.
When you go to your url, in this case, `localhost:8000`, it will display this page, unless you decide otherwise.
We will walk through how to make a page that displays "Hello World!".

First, we need to start adding templates.
In your project folder, create a new folder called "templates".
This is where you will keep you .html files.
There are a few different design patterns for templates that we will learn, but this is where we will start.

Next, go to your `settings.py`.
Towards the top of your `settings.py`, there is a variable called `BASE_DIR`.
This is a definition for your project that tells you the path of the project directory, and will format it.
Underneath the definition of `BASE_DIR`, add the following,

----
TEMPLATE_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')
----

This creates a new variable that stores the location of your template - that is, the folder that you just created.
Then, scroll down further in your `settings.py` and look for a variable called `TEMPLATES`, which contains different settings and options for your templates for your Django project.
Within this list is a dictionary.
There is a key called `DIRS`, with a value of a list.
The value of this item will be a list of locations of where your templates are saved for your Django app.
Within this list, type in `TEMPLATE_DIR` - the variable you just defined.
So, this will look like the following:

[#img-127]
[.text-center]
.`settings.py`
image::12_7.png[settings.py]

We have now set up our Django project to know where to look for our templates.
Our goal is to create a template that says "Hello World" when we visit "localhost:8000".
In the MVT framework, we do not have a model, as there is no data that we will be accessing - just static information in the form of "Hello World."
We need to create a view so the browser can ask for a template.
We have also created a 'templates' folder, but we still need an .html file as a template.

In your 'templates' folder, create a new file called "hello_world.html".
In this file, type the following code:

[literal]
<h1>Hello World!</h1>

Our Django project needs to now be told how to show this .html file

Go to your posts folder and open the `views.py` file.
Within this file, we will be writing functions and classes that will handle our views in the MVT framework.

Type the following after the imports.

----
def hello_world_view(request):
    return render(request, 'hello_world.html')
----

This function takes in the request, and will eventually resolve by returning an .html file (in conjunction with the `urls.py` file).
Your `views.py` file should look like the following:

[#img-128]
[.text-center]
.`views.py`
image::12_8.png[views.py]

Last, we need to create code in our `urls.py` file that will tell our Django project which route will handle our `hello_world.html` file
In the "my_project" folder, open the `urls.py` file.
You will have a list of URL patterns in the form of a list called `urlpatterns`.
This tells the Django project which routes to look for.
Django's URL patterns will need a function to execute so that it knows how to display the template.
We will be giving them the `hello_world_view` function.
So, first import the function after the project imports:

[literal]
from posts.views import hello_world_view

Next, add the following line to the `urlpatterns` list.

[literal]
path('', hello_world_view)

Your `urls.py` file should look like this:

[#img-129]
[.text-center]
.`urls.py`
image::12_9.png[urls.py]

Now, we should be ready to go.
If you no longer have your Django server running, type `python manage.py runserver` into the command prompt.
Otherwise, just refresh the browser you have open.
It should look like the following:

[#img-1210]
[.text-center]
.`Hello World`
image::12_10.png[Hello World]

Congratulations!
You have just made your first Hello World Django project.
Obviously this is a lot of work for just a static website.
This situation would be much easier by just making an html file.
However, a we will see, Django's strengths come from displaying dynamic content.
