== Responsive Design and Bootstrap
Responsive Design is an integral part to modern web design.
Responsive Design refers to a design philosophy that allows a website or web app to look great on screens of all sizes.
Before mobile devices, this was not much of a consideration.
However, as time has gone on, mobile devices and other devices that do not have the same screen size/proportions as normal desktops/laptops have become more and more common.
It is therefore extremely important to create websites that are responsive - that is, responds to changes in the size of the screen.
Let's look at an example.

W3Schools.com implements responsive design.
On a normal screen, the website looks like this:

[#img-41]
[.text-center]
.Desktop View W3 Schools
image::4_1.png[Desktop View W3 Schools]

This is no surprise - it has been seen before.
However, when we look at it on a mobile device, it looks like this:

[#img-4_2]
[.text-center]
.Mobile View W3 Schools
image::4_2.png[Mobile View W3 Schools]

The mobile view is much different than the desktop view: the content becomes stacked on top of each other so it can be easily viewable in the width of the screen.
In addition, the navbar has collapsed, to be expanded when you click the three bars at the top of the screen.
This is a common responsive design tactic for the navbar.
We will go into media queries and then learn Bootstrap, a front end framework developed by Twitter that makes responsive design very easy to implement.

=== Media Queries
A media query is how you can set different styles based on different screen sizes.
In your CSS, you will define all of your styles.
Then, you will create media queries which specify the styles you want in different screen sizes.
So, let's say we have the following code:

----
<html>
    <head>
        <style type = "text/css">
            .responsive-class{
                background-color:yellow;
            }
        </style>
    <head>
    <body>
        <div class = "responsive-class">
            This content is within a responsive class.
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
----

It should not surprise you that it will look like the following in the browser:

[#img-4_3]
[.text-center]
.Responsive Design - Desktop View
image::4_3.png[Responsive Design - Desktop View]

Our webpage will look like this regardless of the size without any media queries.
However, let's change the code in the `<style>` tag to the following:

----
<style>
    .responsive-class{
        background-color: yellow;
    }
    @media (max-width: 500px){
        .responsive-class{
            background-color: red;
        }
    }
</style>
----

[#img-4_4]
[.text-center]
.Responsive Design Under 500px
image::4_4.png[Responsive Design Under 500px]

The image above shows what the webpage will look like given this style.
What this does is set a style on screens with a maximum width of `500px`.
If it is more than `500px`, `.responsive-class' will have a `background-color: yellow;`.
This is the premise of responsive design: you will set media queries for all your classes and ids so they know how to behave on different screen sizes.
You could put any styles in the media query and also change the `max-width` property to `max-height`, `min-width` and `min-height`.
There are many other ways to set media queries, and there are plenty of resources that list these ways out.
Thanks to many different tools on the internet, responsive design can be done much more efficiently than constantly making media queries.
Bootstrap, for example, is a library that does much of this for you.
We will jump into it now.

=== Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a front end framework/library that allows you to easily create mobile-friendly websites.
Not only is it great for mobile websites, but it has a lot of handy helper features that make styling very easy.
Bootstrap makes it very easy to get it in your webpage.
In your `<head>`, simply add the following link:

----
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T" crossorigin="anonymous">
----
Then, at the end of your `<body>`, add the following:

----
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-UO2eT0CpHqdSJQ6hJty5KVphtPhzWj9WO1clHTMGa3JDZwrnQq4sF86dIHNDz0W1" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
----

This is all you need to get Bootstrap started.
Bootstrap is just a stylesheet and Javascript scripts that you can use.
For future reference, you can get your Bootstrap links https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/download/#bootstrapcdn[here].

One of Bootstrap's main features is its grid system.
The grid system organizes the HTML in a way that will change the layout when it goes to certain screen sizes.
As we are going through this chapter, try adjusting the size of your screen to different heights and widths to understand how the style changes.

==== Grid
Bootstrap first starts by using containers.
Containers are used to help organize your html when you are organizing it.
Within containers, you have rows and columns that you organize your code in.

===== Containers
Bootstrap has two types of containers - `container` and `container-fluid`.
A `container` will have a width that is responsive to the size of the screen and will not take up the entire width.
A `container-fluid` element, on the other hand, will have a width of 100% - meaning it will take up the entire width of its parent element.
These are classes that are assigned to html elements.
So, to implement them, you would use the following.

----
<div class = "container" style = "background-color: blue;">
    This is my container.
</div>

<div class = "container-fluid" style = "background-color: red;">
    This is my container-fluid.
</div>
----

[#img-4_5]
[.text-center]
.Containers
image::4_5.png[Containers]

As you can see, the `container` will not have the same width as `container-fluid`.
The `container` class will change its width depending on the size of the screen, whereas `container-fluid` will always have `width: 100%`.
You will typically apply these classes to `<div>` elements.

===== Rows
Within a container, you will have multiple rows.
This is how Bootstrap arranges content - rows within a container.

It is defined as the following:
----
<div class = "container">
    <div class = "row">
        CONTENT GOES HERE
    </div>
</div>
----

===== Columns
Bootstrap's columns is where the magic really happens.
Within each row, there are twelve potential columns.
However, there can be anywhere between 1-12 columns per row.
It is segmented by 1, and you will want the class of your columns to add up to 12.
This does not mean a lot without looking at it more.

Let's say we have content that we want to be split into two columns of equal width on a page.
We can simply will type the following:

----
<div class = "container">
    <div class = "row">
        <div class = "col-6">
            This is "col-6"
        </div>
        <div class = "col-6">
            This is the second "col-6"
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
----

Which will result in the following:

[#img-4_6]
[.text-center]
.Columns
image::4_6.png[Columns]

The two columns will take up 6 of the 12 sections that Bootstrap divides rows up into.
That means that each column will take up half of the screen.
We could also do the following:

----
<div class = "container">
    <div class = "row">
        <div class = "col-4">
            This is "col-4"
        </div>
        <div class = "col-4">
            This is the second "col-4"
        </div>
        <div class = "col-4">
            This is the third "col-4"
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
----

This would look like this:

[#img-4_7]
[.text-center]
.Three Columns
image::4_7.png[Three Columns]

Each of these columns will take up one third of the page.
This makes it easy for responsive pages, as the actual width of the columns will change based on the size of the screen.

However, Bootstrap makes it even better.
What if our screen gets too skinny?
Our columns will get very squished and we would potentially see one word per line per column, like the following:

[#img-4_8]
[.text-center]
.Skinny Screen
image::4_8.png[Skinny Screen]

Bootstrap sets up media queries to take care of this.
They have set four different screen sizes: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, and `lg`.
These screen sizes correspond to different breakpoints.

.Summary of Bootstrap Breakpoints
|===
|Label |Breakpoint

|`sm`
|Greater than or equal to `576px`

|`md`
|Greater than or equal to `768px`

|`lg`
|Greater than or equal to `992px`

|`xl`
|Greater than `1200px`

|===

So, the way these work is to implement them in the `col-` classes.
The syntax would be `col-[breakpoint]-[number]`.
Let's jump right into an example.

----
<div class = "container">
    <div class = "row">
        <div class = "col-sm-3">
            This is "col-sm-3"
        </div>
        <div class = "col-sm-3">
            This is the second "col-sm-3"
        </div>
        <div class = "col-sm-3">
            This is the third "col-sm-3"
        </div>
        <div class = "col-sm-3">
            This is the fourth "col-sm-3"
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
----

This will create breakpoints at 576 pixels.
What the html classes are saying is that when the width of screen is at 576 pixels or more, the columns will stay next to each other.
However once it goes below, the content will stack on top of each other.

[#img-4_9]
[.text-center]
.Over 576px on left, under 576px on right
image::4_9.png[Over 576px on left, under 576px on right]

You can do the same with the `md`, `lg`, and `xl` with a variety of columns.
We can also apply multiple breakpoints.
Let's say we have four `col-3` in a row.
When we get to a certain point, we want two rows of `col-6` and when it gets smaller, then we want it to be four rows.
This will be done using the following code:


----
<div class = "container">
    <div class = "row">
        <div class = "col-md-3 col-sm-6">
            This is "col-sm-3"
        </div>
        <div class = "col-md-3 col-sm-6">
            This is the second "col-sm-3"
        </div>
        <div class = "col-md-3 col-sm-6">
            This is the third "col-sm-3"
        </div>
        <div class = "col-md-3 col-sm-6">
            This is the fourth "col-sm-3"
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
----

It tells the columns how to behave in different breakpoints.
So, first it will abide by the `col-md-3` behavior, then it will abide by the `col-sm-6` behavior.
Our webpage will look like the following:

Before it hits `md`:
[#img-4_10]
[.text-center]
.Greater than `768px`
image::4_10.png[Greater than `768px`]

Before it hits `sm`:
[#img-4_11]
[.text-center]
.Greater than `576px`
image::4_11.png[Greater than `576px`]

Before it goes below `sm`:
[#img-4_12]
[.text-center]
.Less than `576px`
image::4_12.png[Less than `576px`]

Now that we have learned how the Bootstrap grid works, let's look at some other Bootstrap features.

==== Other Features
Bootstrap is great for responsive design for the entire layout of the page.
It also has a few other utilities that make it useful.

===== Navbar
The Bootstrap Navbar is one of the best features, in my opinion.
It creates a navigation bar that collapses when it gets to a certain breakpoint.
So, it will look like a normal navigation bar at the top of the screen until it hits a certain point.
Then, it will collapse the actual navigation links and show a button that you can click to reveal the navigation links.
Bootstrap has great documentation, so whenever I need a component, such as a navbar, I will start off with the code they have in an example, and then change it accordingly.
Using the https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/navbar/[Navbar from Bootstrap's documentation], we can start with the following code.

----
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
    <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Navbar</a>
    <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarSupportedContent" aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
        <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
    </button>

    <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent">
        <ul class="navbar-nav mr-auto">
        <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="#">Home</a>
        </li>
        <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="#">Link</a>
        </li>
    </div>
</nav>
----

In a screen that is `992px` and larger, it will look like this:

[#img-4_13]
[.text-center]
.Greater than or equal to `992px`
image::4_13.png[Greater than or equal to `992px`]

And smaller screens, such as mobile, will look like this:

[#img-4_14]
[.text-center]
.Less than `992px`
image::4_14.png[Less than `992px`]


Their default Navbar in the first example code is much more complex, with many different item types.
However, let's start with the previous code.

We first have our entire `<nav>` tag that will be the parent.
The `class=navbar-expand-lg` will determine when the navbar collapses, which is the `992px` breakpoint.
Then, we have our first link with `class="navbar-brand"`.
This is where you would put the title of your page, let's say, or maybe a logo.

Then, you have a button with `class="navbar-toggler"`.
This is what shows up when your screen is under `992px`.

We can now go to the links of the navbar, `<div class = "collapse navbar-collapse">`.
This is the part of the navbar that will collapse.
Within this, we have our `class="navbar-nav"` which is where all of the links are.

Those are the basics of navbars.
You can look at the documentation for all of different types of links for navs.

===== Common CSS Classes
Bootstrap has a lot of helper functions that assist with common CSS styling.
These include padding, margins, display and position, among others.

Generally speaking, there is a very simple pattern to apply certain styles to a tag.
They will start with a prefix:

. `padding`: `p`
. `margin`: `m`
. `display`: `d`
. `position`: `position`

====== Padding and Margin

Let's look at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/utilities/spacing/[`padding` and `margin`].
After the first letter, you will have another letter or a `-`.

. `-`: all
. `t`: `top`
. `b`: `bottom`
. `l`: `left`
. `r`: `right`

This shows where you will put the `padding` or `margin`.
Then, you will put an integer between 0 and 5, or `auto` to determine how much margin or padding.
These integers will increase the amount of padding or margin, based on Bootstrap's own calculations that you can change with Sass.
So, let's look at a few examples.

. `pt-1`: `padding-top`
. `mb-3`: `margin-bottom`.
. `p-2`: `padding`

The integers, once again, are determined by Bootstrap, but can be changed.
For beginners, you can just use these classes to have a general increase or decrease in padding/margins, but you will not be able to be very specific.

====== Display
We first use `d` to set a class for `display`, then we put one of the values for `display`, such as `inline` or `inline-block`.

. `d-inline`: `display: inline`
. `d-none`: `display: none`

We can also mix in some break points, such as `d-md-none`, which will give the element a `display: none` value below the `md` breakpoint.

====== Position
Position is easy.
All you need is the `position-` prefix, and then type the value you want.
The following will give the `<div>` the style `position: absolute`.

----
<div class = "position-absolute">
</div>
----

Bootstrap has many, many great features, and we barely covered them in this chapter.
I suggest to read the documentation more and use it when you can see the functionality of it.
When we start creating a Django project, we will implement these features on the front end.
