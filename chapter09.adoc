== Advanced Django: Users
Django is great for setting up databases and such, but Django has a bunch of added things that really take your project to the next level.
These functions include setting up Users in your model, which Django has plenty of different tools to make this easy.
We will also look at ways to make your Django projects more secure, as well as signals, class based views and Django forms.

Django has a great framework for handling Users.
It has a built in model, called User.
There are a few ways to access this model, and we will look at the pros and cons of each.
In our project, we want to add a user field to our blog posts so we know who the author is.

=== The User Model
Django has a built in model, the User model.
It is just like the models we have seen in the past.
When we want to create a new user, the implementation of this model will help us change the database.
The User model is of `class models.User`.
Every new instance of the User model will be another user.
Each user has a few fields.
These fields include the `username`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `password`.
There are several other fields that the User model has, but these are the main ones you will be using on a regular basis.
If we wanted to create a User, we could go in the shell and do the following:

----
from django.contrib.auth import User
new_user = User.objects.create_user(username='myusername', email="test@test.com", password="password!123")
----

This will create a new user in the database.
As a layer of safety, Django does not save the raw password in the database.
It saves an encrypted version of it.

However, how should we organize the Users?
I typically create a new app for that, called 'accounts'.
So, let's do that by going into the command line and typing

----
python manage.py startapp accounts
----

Then, we need to go into `settings.py` and add the accounts app to the `INSTALLED_APPS`.
Once we have this, we can start writing our views.
Remember, we already have a built in User model, so we will not need to create one in `models.py`.

NOTE: As you continue in your programming career, you will likely want to create your own User model.
This can be done by starting off with the Django models and then changing them accordingly.

Now, let's set up our views.
Users are just like any other model - we will need to create a user, that is, a sign up feature.
We will also need to be able to login and logout.
Then, we want to be able to have a profile view so that you can view the individual user.

We can initially set up our 'accounts/views.py' as the following:

[#img-151]
[.text-center]
.accounts/views.py
image::15_1.png[accounts/views.py]

We have created our four main views.
Also, note the imports in the template.
This is using Django's built in authentication methods.
Not only does Django have the built in User model, but it also has methods to help the entire User authentication process.
The methods include logging in, authenticating and logging out.
We also have the ability to create a user using the User model manager, `User.objects.create_user()`.

However, where does the User model come from?
Typically, we would have imported the User model from 'accounts/models.py'.
But, Django has the User model already created, so we will look at the various ways to import the User model.

==== Importing the User Class
We could directly import the User model.
This is just like importing a normal model, but it will be a User model.

We do this with the following import:

----
from django.contrib.auth import User
----

This way we can reference the User model any time in the same way we would reference our Post model.
However, this is not the ideal way to reference the User model.
What if we end up extending the User model for our project?
For example, if we make a class that inherits from User, we will want to reference that model.
In Django, we can set which model we want to use for the User.
So, we want to prepare for these instances.

==== get_user_model
The `get_user_model` function will do exactly what it says.
It will return the User model that is activated in the project, and will default to `django.contrib.auth.User`.
We implement it the following way:

----
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model

User = get_user_model()
----

We first import the method `get_user_model`.
Then, we define a variable, called `User`.
In theory, we could name this anything, such as `banana`.
The variable will just save the value that is returned from `get_user_model`.

==== AUTH_USER_MODEL
We can also import Django's settings module and then reference the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` variable.
Per Django's documentation, it is best to use this when referring to a custom user model in foreign key relationships.

----
from django.conf import settings

User = settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL
----

A great thread on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24629705/django-using-get-user-model-vs-settings-auth-user-model[Stack Overflow] discusses the differences between `get_user_model` and `AUTH_USER_MODEL` in more detail.

=== User Views
Now, let's go back to the 'accounts/views.py' and import the User model via `get_user_model()`.
We will start off with the `user_create_view`.

We will be creating users with three fields: `username`, `email` and `password`.
So, let's write the `accounts/create.html` template.
This will be written as the following:

----
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block base_content %}
    <div class = "container pt-5">
        <div class = "display-4">
            Sign Up
        </div>
        <br/>
        <form method="POST">
            {% csrf_token %}
            <div class = "form-group">
                <label for = "username">Username</label>
                <input type="text" name="username" class = "form-control" required/>
            </div>
            <div class = "form-group">
                <label for = "email">Email</label>
                <input type="email" name="email" class = "form-control" required/>
            </div>
            <div class = "form-group">
                <label for = "password">Password</label>
                <input type="password" name="password" class = "form-control" required/>
            </div>
            <div class = "form-group">
                <label for = "confirm-password">Confirm Password</label>
                <input type="password" name="confirm-password" class = "form-control" required/>
            </div>
            <input type = "submit" value = "Sign Up" class = "btn btn-md btn-primary" />
        </form>
    </div>
{% endblock base_content %}
----

Remember - the class `pt-` is `padding-top`.
We are using Bootstrap classes, `form-group` and `form-control`.
We also added another input - `confirm-password`.
This is so we can confirm there are no typos in their password.
Also, we added the `required` attribute for each field.
This is a special HTML attribute that allows us to check if the input is empty before it hits the server.

Next, let's add the path to 'accounts/urls.py'.
If you haven't already, create the file 'urls.py' in your 'accounts' app.
Then, let's include the 'accounts.urls' in our 'myproject.urls' by adding the following `path`:

----
path('accounts/', include('accounts.urls', namespace='accounts'))
----

After adding all of our code into our 'accounts/urls.py', it will look like this:

----
from django.urls import path

from .views import user_create_view

app_name = 'accounts'

urlpatterns = [
    path('create/', user_create_view, name="create"),
]
----

So, whenever we use `{% url %}` in our templates to reference the 'accounts/create/', we will use `{% url 'accounts:create' %}`.
When we visit it in our browser, it will resemble:

[#img-152]
[.text-center]
.localhost:8000/accounts/create
image::15_2.png[.localhost:8000/accounts/create]

This is exactly what we want.
You can try to submit the form with bad email formatting or with one of the fields empty.
Thanks to the HTML input types and the `required` attribute, a lot of our validation is done on the front end.

However, we cannot do all of our validation on the front end, so let's go back to our 'accounts/views.py'.
We need to do the following checks:

1. See if the passwords equal each other
2. See if the username is taken
3. See if the email is already being used

So, within the `if request.method == "POST":` block, we can first check if the passwords equal.
This way we can do the first check without having to check the database.
In order to access the values, we can store the values in the inputs.

----
def user_create_view(request):
    context = {}
    if request.method == "POST":
        password = request.POST['password']
        confirm_password = request.POST['confirm-password']
        if password == confirm_password:
            #go to next check
            return render(request, 'accounts/create.html', context)
        else:
            context['error'] = "Passwords don't match"
            return render(request, 'accounts/create.html', context)
    else:
        return render(request, 'accounts/create.html', context)
----

Our `user_create_view` now has our first check.
We also added a context variable to our output.
We want to somehow send an error message if there is an issue, so this will be done in the context.
We will define `context['error']` in each block so that it is specific, and we know what exactly went wrong.
That means we will have to add the error message code in our template as well.
You can put this anywhere, but I typically put it right above the form, below the "Sign Up" title.
We will use Bootstrap's `text-danger` class.

----
{% if error %}
    <div class = "text-danger">
        {{error}}
    </div>
{% endif %}
----

We don't want to include the code if the `error` key is empty, so we first check if it exists.
If it does, then we inject the HTML.

We will next have to check if the username or email is already in the system.
The logic is this: we will try to query the database and look for Users with the username/email that is given.
If there is an error, that is: `User.DoesNotExist`, then we can create a new User.

So, let's jump right in:

----
if password == confirm_password:
    username = request.POST['username']
    try:
        User.objects.get(username=username)
        context['error'] = "Username is taken"
        return render(request, 'accounts/create.html', context)
    except User.DoesNotExist:
        email = request.POST['email']
        try:
            User.objects.get(email=email)
            context['error'] = "Email already in system"
            return render(request, 'accounts/create.html', context)
        except User.DoesNotExist:
            user = User.objects.create_user(username=username, email=email, password=password)
            context['success'] = "Your Account is Created!"
            return render(request, 'accounts/create.html', context)
----
After we check if the passwords match, we try to get the user by the username.
If we throw an exception, that is actually good, because we don't have the username in the database.
If we do not throw an exception, then our error message is `"Username is taken"`.
Then, we check for a user with the email, using the same strategy.
We could have done both the email and username check in the same `try` block, but it makes it easier this way to see which field is causing the error.

If we create the user, then we have a new context item, `success`.
This message will say `"Your Account is Created!"`.
We will not have both a success message and an error message, so we can rewrite our template like this:

----
{% if error %}
    <div class = "text-danger">
        {{error}}
    </div>
{% elif success %}
    <div class = "text-success">
        {{success}}
    </div>
{% endif %}
----

This uses Bootstrap's `text-success` class, which is a green color.
Now that we have this set up, try creating a user and make the passwords different.

Then, create a legitimate `User` instance and remember the username and email you type.
You should see the following if it was done correctly:

[#img-153]
[.text-center]
.User Success
image::15_3.png[User Success]

Then, try to create another user with the same username/email.
You should get error message if you cannot create it.
We have officially created our `user_create_view`.

Now, let's create our `user_login_view`.
We first need to try to `authenticate` the User.
This will actually verify that there is a user with the username and password provided.
Then, we will login that user.

Let's quickly create our template, 'accounts/login.html':

----
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block base_content %}
    <div class = "container pt-5">
        <div class = "display-4">
            Log In
        </div>
        {% if error %}
            <div class = "text-danger">
                {{error}}
            </div>
        {% elif success %}
            <div class = "text-success">
                {{success}}
            </div>
        {% endif %}
        <br />
        <form method="POST">
            {% csrf_token %}
            <div class = "form-group">
                <label for = "username">Username</label>
                <input type="text" name="username" class = "form-control" required/>
            </div>
            <div class = "form-group">
                <label for = "password">Password</label>
                <input type="password" name="password" class = "form-control" required/>
            </div>
            <input type = "submit" value = "Log In" class = "btn btn-md btn-primary" />
        </form>
    </div>
{% endblock base_content %}
----

Now, let's work in our 'accounts/views.py'.
So, we will import the `authenticate` and `login` functions from `django.contrib.auth`.
Our import should look like this now:

----
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, get_user_model, login
----

Authentication works by sending the username and login to the `authenticate` function.
If there is no User with those credentials, it will return `None`.
Otherwise, it will return the user.

So, our code will look like this:

----
def user_login_view(request):
    context = {}
    if request.method=="POST":
        username = request.POST['username']
        password = request.POST['password']
        user = authenticate(username=username, password=password)
        if user is not None:
            login(request, user)
            context['success'] = "You are logged in!"
            return render(request, 'accounts/login.html', context)
        else:
            context['error'] = "Invalid Login"
            return render(request, 'accounts/login.html', context)
    else:
        return render(request, 'accounts/login.html', context)
----

The `login` function takes in `request` as its first argument, then the user that has been authenticated as its second.
If you try logging in with the user you just made, you should see a success message, otherwise, any other combination will result in an error.
Lastly, we need to let the client call our function by adding the url to the 'accounts/urls.py'.
Add the following `path` to your `urlpatterns`:

----
path('login/', user_login_view, name="login")
----

We have officially created `user_login_view`.
Now, let's do the `user_logout_view`.

We will need to place a logout button on each page, so it's time to put a navbar in.
Go to your 'base.html' file and put in a navbar above the `{% block base_content %}` and outside of the `<div class = "container">`.
We will use Bootstrap's collapsible navbar.
Generally, you can just go to their website and copy the code you need and make any changes you need.

----
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
    <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Django Blog</a>
    <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#mainNav" aria-controls="mainNav" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
        <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
    </button>

    <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="mainNav">
        <ul class="navbar-nav mr-auto">
            <li class="nav-item active">
                <a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'posts:list' %}">All Posts</a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'posts:create' %}">Create Post</a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link" href="#">Log Out</a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'accounts:login' %}">Log In</a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'accounts:create' %}">Sign Up</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</nav>
----

We have added all of our User authentication buttons in our navbar.
You may have noticed something - we will not need all of our authentication button at once.
If nobody is logged in, then we will not need the "Log Out" button, and we don't want them to be able to "Create Post".

If somebody is logged in, we don't need the "Login" button or the "Sign Up" button.
Luckily, Django has a very simple way to check if a user is authenticated in the template.

----
{% if user.is_authenticated %}
    <div>User is authenticated</div>
{% else %}
    <div>User is not authenticated</div>
{% endif %}
----

Now we can just plug this into the navbar.
Use the following:

----
<ul class="navbar-nav mr-auto">
    <li class="nav-item active">
        <a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'posts:list' %}">All Posts</a>
    </li>
    {% if user.is_authenticated %}
        <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'posts:create' %}">Create Post</a>
        </li>
        <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="#">Log Out</a>
        </li>
    {% else %}
        <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'accounts:login' %}">Log In</a>
        </li>
        <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'accounts:create' %}">Sign Up</a>
        </li>
    {% endif %}
</ul>
----

Depending on if you are logged in or not, you should see the "Log Out" and "Create Post" buttons or the "Log In" and "Sign Up" buttons.

Next, let's finish up the `user_logout_view`.
We need to first check is the user is authenticated.
If the user is authenticated, then we will log out.
If the user is not authenticated, and they just went to that page somehow by mistake, we will redirect to the login page.
We will need to import the `redirect` function:

----
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
----

We already have render imported.
Now, let's write the function.

----
def user_logout_view(request):
    if request.user.is_authenticated:
        logout(request)
        return redirect('posts:list')
    else:
        return redirect('accounts:login')
----

So, if the user is authenticated, it will log the user out.
Then, it will redirect to the `posts:list` url.
`redirect` works by taking in a string in the same way `{% url %}` does.
Now we add a path to the `accounts/urls.py`.
Remember to import `user_logout_view`.

----
path('logout/', user_logout_view, name="logout")
----

Now we can add the `href` attribute to the button in the navbar.
----
<li class="nav-item">
    <a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'accounts:logout' %}">Log Out</a>
</li>
----
Try testing it out.
If you are not logged in, and you go to 'localhost:8000/accounts/logout', you should be redirected to the login screen.
If you are logged in, and go to that URL click the 'Logout' button, you should be redirected to the `post:list` url, that is, `post_list_view`.

We have officially added all of our authentication views.
Now we will be adding the user model as a foreign key in a model.

=== Adding the User as a Foreign Key
In our 'posts/models.py', we want to add an author field so that we can see who wrote the blog post.
We will use the `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` approach.

This is when we introduce the idea of a Foreign Key.
A Foreign Key relationship is a 'one-to-many' relationship.
This means that there are two types of objects that can be related.
But, there is a one way relationship.

Let's look at the example of the `Post` model.
Each instance of `Post` will have an author.
An author is an instance of the `User` model.
So, one author can have many different posts.
However, every post can only have one author.
This is a 'one-to-many' relationship in action.

Let's add this in our model.
We can change our 'posts/models.py' to look like this:

----
from django.db import models
from django.conf import settings

User = settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL

class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length = 150)
    content = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add = True)
    last_updated = models.DateTimeField(auto_now = True)
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
----

So, we import the `settings` and define our `User`.
Then, we create a new field, `author`, that is a `ForeignKey`, pointing to the User model.
In addition, we have the `on_delete` argument.
You may want to go into the shell and delete all Posts, because we are adding a non-nullable field to an already existing instance.
Or, when you migrate, you can just add a default value, that will be prompted on the `migrate` command.
So, let's perform our migrations:

----
python manage.py makemigrations
----

then,

----
python manage.py migrate
----

We will now have our `author` field added.
How do we set the author, though when we are creating a model?
We will now be updating our post views with our new `author` field.

=== Integrating the author field with our Views
First, let's change `post_create_view`.
We first should limit this view for those that are logged in.
We don't want anonymous users to be able to create a post.
Django has a nifty way to do this.
Go to your 'posts/views.py' and import the following:

----
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
----

This is a decorator that allows us to limit a view if someone is logged in.
All you do once you import it, is add `@login_required` right on top of the view.
So, change your `post_create_view` to look like this:

----
@login_required
def post_create_view(request):
----

Now, you will not be able to access that view unless you are logged in.
And, through Django magic, if you are not logged in, it will redirect you to your login page.
Give it a try.
This is because it will redirect to 'accounts/login' by default.
You can change this if you want to, but that is outside the context of this class.

Now that we are only allows those that are logged in to create a post, we can simply get the current user, and use that for the `author` field.
The way we can do this is by accessing the User in the `request` object.
We have already used this in the past, to check `request.method` and the `request.POST`.
Now, we will will the `request.user`.
This is the current user's `User` instance.
So, we can go back into our `post_create_view` and add the current user.

This would look like this:

----
if title and content:
    author = request.user
    post = Post.objects.create(title=title, content=content, author=author)
    return redirect('posts:detail', id=post.id)
----

Remember, this is within our `post_create_view` after we check if we have our `title` and `content`.
If you are logged in, you will be able to test this out.
Let's first go the the 'posts/detail.html' template and add the author.
Where we put the "Created" and "Updated" fields.

----
<p>Created: {{post.created_at}} | Updated: {{post.last_updated}} | Written by: {{post.author.username}}</p>
----

Next, go to 'localhost:8000/posts/create' and create a new post.
When it is redirected, it should go to the 'posts:detail' view and say the username.
My username for the user is 'username', so it will look like this:

[#img-154]
[.text-center]
.Post Detail with Author
image::15_4.png[Post Detail with Author]

Now we need to think about how to change the rest of the views now that we have users.
Any views that change the database will need the `@login_required` tag.

----
@login_required
def post_update_view(request, id):

@login_required
def post_delete_view(request, id):
----

These two views will require a valid login.
However, we also want to make sure that the only person that can change the post is the author.
So, we can make a new template in our 'posts' folder, called 'posts/unauthorized.html'.
It can say anything, but I put the following:

----
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block base_content %}
<div class = "row">
    <h1>UNAUTHORIZED</h1>
</div>
{% endblock base_content %}
----

So now in our `post_update_view` and `post_delete_view`, we will first check if the currently logged in user, `request.user` is the same as the `author`.

----
@login_required
def post_update_view(request, id):
    post = Post.objects.filter(id=id).first()
    context = { 'post': post }
    if request.user == post.author:
        if request.method == "POST":
            updated_title = request.POST['post-title']
            updated_content = request.POST['post-content']
            if updated_title and updated_content:
                updated_post = Post.objects.filter(id=id).update(title = updated_title, content = updated_content)
                return redirect('posts:detail', id=post.id)
            else:
                context['error'] = "Both Title and Content are necessary!"
                return render(request, 'posts/update.html', context = context)
        else:
            return render(request, 'posts/update.html', context = context)
    else:
----

Now, if we were to create another user, and try to click the 'Edit' button on a certain `Post` instance, we will see the 'posts/unauthorized.html' template.
There are a few different ways to do this.
We could also redirect to the login view, or we could make another view entirely, at let's say, '/posts/unauthorized'.
This is just a simple way.
We can do the same for the `post_update_view`.

----
@login_required
def post_delete_view(request, id):
    post = Post.objects.filter(id=id).first()
    context = { 'post': post }
    if request.user == post.author:
        if request.method == "POST":
            post = Post.objects.filter(id=id).delete()
            return redirect('posts:list')
        else:
            return render(request, 'posts/delete.html', context = context)
    else:
        return render(request, 'posts/unauthorized.html')
----

Notice that the `@login_required` tag is now irrelevant for the `post_update_view` and `post_delete_view`.
This is because we are doing a check for the current user anyways, so we won't be able to see the view if we are not logged in as the current user.
So, let's delete it for these two views.

Lastly, let's see how this affects our templates.
In our 'posts/detail.html' template, we only want to show the "Edit" and "Delete" button if the current user is the author.
In our 'posts/detail.html', we should change our code with the following `if` statement:

----
{% if user == post.author %}
    <a href="{% url 'posts:update' id=post.id %}" class="btn btn-md btn-success">Edit</a>
    <a href="{% url 'posts:delete' id=post.id %}" class="btn btn-md btn-warning">Delete</a>
{% endif %}
----

We have changed all of our views and models to include users.
As you have seen, Django does a lot to help with this.
